This game is my opinion. 
There is a black square in the middle of the screen. This is you. You can move with direction keys. 
Our goal is to eat the yellow squares. We earn points when we eat the yellow squares.
We have some problems. Red squares is coming from edges of screen. We need to escape from these. 
If the black square and the red square overlap, game over.
